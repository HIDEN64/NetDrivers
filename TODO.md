# NetDrivers
A driver storage and indexing website.

### To-Do
- [ ] Add more functionality to devices.php
- [ ] Rename systems.php and devices.php to system.php and device.php respectively
- [ ] Add all files, etc to database (INTERNAL ONLY)
- [ ] Add file download links to both system and device pages

### Notes from Animadoria
> Some things that need to be improved:
>
> - Use require() instead of include()
> - The database needs to be refactored. Triggers are essential
> - Database functions should be moved to a single class or multiple that extend one that connects
> - Tons of things should be moved to functions
