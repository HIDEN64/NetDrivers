## Contributing

A list of possible items for contributions/pull requests can be found in [TODO.md](TODO.md)

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

**NOTE:** Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
